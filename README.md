# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Machine-learning
This project focuses on real-time sign language detection using machine learning and computer vision to assist individuals who are deaf or mute. It involves training a model on a labeled dataset of hand signs (A-Z, 1-9) in grayscale to recognize and translate sign language into text.
